# Booleans

A boolean is an expression that evaluates to either True or False. Here is an example of a boolean expression:

```python
 1 < 2
```

It asks the question: is the value on the left smaller than the value on the right?

## Comparison Operators

To compare values in python, we can use comparison operators .

Here are the comprison operators:
|Operator  | Meaning                  | Example    | Value |
| -------- | ------------------------ | ---------- | ----- |
| ==       | equals                   | 1 + 1 == 2 | True  |
| !=       | does not equal           | 3.2 != 2.5 | True  |
| <        | less than                | 10 < 5     | False |
| >        | greater than             | 10 > 5     | True  |
| <=       | less than or equal to    | 126 <= 100 | False |
| >=       | greater than or equal to | 5.0 >= 5.0 | True  |

We can use comparison operators to make conditions for if statements and while loops.

As you might have guessed, comparison operators play nicely with variables. Let's use the interpreter to get some practice with boolean expressions:
Logical Operators

Logical operators can be used to change or combine boolean statements.

Here are the logical operators:
| Operator | Example              | Result |
| -------- | -------------------- | ------ |
| not      | not (2 == 3)         | True   |
| and      | (2 ==3) and (-1 < 5) | False  |
| or       | (2 == 3) or (-1 < 5) | True   |

## Boolean Variables

Just like how you can have variables that store integer or string values, you can also have variables that store boolean values.

```python
# Store expressions that evaluate to True/False
x = 1 < 2    #True
y = 5.0 == 4.0    #False 

# Directly set to True/False 
is_sheltering = True
is_raining = False 

play_again = input('Play again? "y" or "n"') == 'y'
if play again: 
   ...
```
