# Dictionaries

## What are Dictionaries?

Dictionaries associate a key with a value

* **Key** is a unique identifier
* **Value** is something we associate with that key

Here are some examples of dictionaries in the real world:

* Phonebook:
  * Keys: names
  * Values: phone numbers
* Dictionary
  * Keys: words
  * Values: word definitions
* US Government
  * Keys: Social Security number
  * Values: Information about an individual's employment

## Dictionaries in Python

### Creating dictionaries

* Dictionary start/end with braces: {}
* Key:Value pairs are separated by a colon
* Each pair is separated by a comma

Here is how to create a dictionary that stores the ages of the members of our teaching team: Chris, Brahm, and Mehran.

```python
ages = {'Chris': 32, 'Brahm': 23, 'Mehran': 50}
```

## Accessing elements of a dictionary:

* We can use keys to access their associated value

```python
    ages['Chris'] # is 32
    ages['Mehran'] # is 50
```

* We can set values like regular variables

```python
    ages['Mehran'] = 18 # sets Mehran's age to 18

    ages['Mehran'] += 3 # adds 3 to Mehran's age
```

* If we try to access a key that is not in the dictionary, we will get an error. For example, here is the console output if we try to find Brahm's age:

```python
    >>> brahms_age = ages['Brahm']
    >>> brahms_age
    23
```

  However, we get an error if we try to access Santa Claus's age, which is not in the dictionary:

```python
    >>> santas_age = ages['Santa Claus']
    KeyError: 'Santa Claus' 
```

  KeyError means that the key we provided is not in the dictionary.

* We can use the keyword `in` to check if a key is in a dictionary, using a boolean expression to return true or false:

```python
    >>> 'Brahm' in ages
    True
    >>> 'Santa Claus' not in ages
    True
```

### Adding elements to a dictionary

* We can add and change pairs in a dictionary

```python
    phone = {} # starting with an empty dictionary 
    phone['Pat'] = '555-1212'
    phone['Jenny'] = '867-5309'
    phone['Pat'] = None
    phone['Pat'] = '867-5309'
```

* Hereâ€™s what the dictionary looks like after these names are added:

```python
    {'Pat': '867-5309', 'Jenny': '867-5309'}
```

### A word about Keys/Values

* Keys must be immutable types (eg. int, float, string)
  * Keys cannot be changed in place
  * If you want to change a key, need to remove key/value pair from dictionary and then add key/value pair with new key.
* Values can be mutable or immutable types (eg. int, float, string, lists, dictionaries -- yes, you can have a dictionary of dictionaries!)
  * Values can be changed in place
* Dictionaries are mutable. This means changes made to a dictionary in a function persist after the function is done.

Let's take a further look at the significance of dictionaries being mutable. Here's an example, which takes our dictionary of ages and adds one to the age when a person has a birthday:

```python
def have_birthday(dict, name):
    print("You're one year older, " + name + "!")
    dict[name] += 1

def main():
    ages = {'Chris': 32, 'Brahm': 23, 'Mehran': 50}
    print(ages)
    have_birthday(ages, 'Chris')
    print(ages)
    have_birthday(ages, 'Mehran')
    print(ages)
```

This is what the program prints out:

```bash
{'Chris': 32, 'Brahm': 23, 'Mehran': 50}
You're one year older, Chris!
{'Chris': 33, 'Brahm': 23, 'Mehran': 50}
You're one year older, Mehran!
{'Chris': 33, 'Brahm': 23, 'Mehran': 51}
```

Because dictionaries are mutable, changes made to the dictionary in the `have_birthday` function persist in the main function

### Functions you can apply to dictionaries

We will now provide some useful functions you can apply to dictionaraies! We'll demonstrate them on our ages dictionary:

```python
 ages = {'Chris': 32, 'Brahm': 23, 'Mehran': 50} 
```

#### `dict.get(key)`

Returns value associated with key in dictionary. Returns None if key doesn't exist.

```python
>>> print(ages.get('Chris'))
32
>>> print(ages.get('Santa Claus')) 
None
```

#### `dict.get(key, default)`

Returns value associated with key in dictionary. Returns default if key doesn't exist.

```python
 >>> print(ages.get('Chris', 100))
32
>>> print(ages.get('Santa Claus', 100))
100
```

#### `dict.keys()`

Returns something similar to a range of the keys in dictionary. We can use this to loop over all the keys in a dictionary:

```python
for key in ages.keys():
    print(str(key) + ", " + str(ages[key]))
```

We can also turn `keys()` into a list using the `list` function

```python
 >>> list(ages.keys())
    ['Chris', 'Brahm', 'Mehran']
```

We can also loop over a dictionary using for-each loop just using name of dictionary:

```python
for key in ages:
    print(str(key) + ", " + str(ages[key]))
```

#### `dict.values()`

Returns something similar to a range of the values in dictionary. We can use this to loop over all the values in a dictionary:

```python
for value in ages.values():
      print(value)
```

We can also turn `values()` into a list using the `list` function

```python
>>> list(ages.values())
    [32, 23, 50]
```

#### `dict.pop(key)`

Removes key/value pair with the given key. Returns value from that key/value pair.

```python
>>> ages
>>> {'Chris': 32, 'Brahm': 23, 'Mehran': 50}
>>> ages.pop('Mehran')
50
>>> ages
{'Chris': 32, 'Brahm': 23}
```

#### `dict.clear()`

Removes all key/value pairs in the dictionary.

```python
>>> ages.clear()
>>> ages
{}
```

#### `len(dict)`

Returns number of key/value pairs in the dictionary

```python
>>> ages
{'Chris': 32, 'Brahm': 23, 'Mehran': 50}
>>> len(ages)
3
```

#### `del dict[key]`

Removes key/value pair with the given key. It's similar to pop, but doesn't return anything.

```python
>>> ages
{'Chris': 32, 'Brahm': 23, 'Mehran': 50}
>>> del ages['Mehran']
>>> ages
{'Chris': 32, 'Brahm': 23}
```
